Amazing job! We learned a lot in this lesson so let’s review some of the topics.

score = 60
hasFreePass = false

if score == 100 or hasFreePass then
  print("You got an A+")
elseif score < 100 and score >= 70 then
  print("You passed")
elseif not (score == 0) then
  print("You were so close! Better luck next time")
else
  print("You didn't even take it!'")
end


A control structure is code that makes a decision based on one or more true/false statements.
Conditional statements are used to create a control structure and include if, elseif, and else statements.
if: starts off our if-based control structure. Evaluates a boolean expression and executes a block of code if it is true.
elseif: Used to evaluate more boolean expressions if the prior conditions are not met.
else: Used to execute code when all of the prior if statements’ conditions are not met. else can only used at the end of an if-based control structure.
A code block is a grouping of code. Control structures determine if/when they will be executed.
Boolean expressions evaluate to true or false and are used by conditional statements to decide if the code block should be executed.
Comparison operators compare any two values and evaluate them as true or false.
A > B: A Greater than B
A >= B: A Greater than or Equal to B
A < B: A Less than B
A <= B: A Less than or Equal to B
A == B: A Equals B
A ~= B: A doesn’t Equal B
Logical operators take two boolean

 and evaluate to either true or false.
A and B: evaluates true if both A and B are true
A or B: evaluates true if either A or B is true
not A: evaluates as the opposite of A.
