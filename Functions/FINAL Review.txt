Congratulations on working through functions! Let’s review what we learned

function getTravelTime(mph, miles)
  travelTime = miles / mph
  return travelTime
end

getTravelTime(10, 60) – returns a value of 6


Functions are important for maximizing code-writing efficiency because they allow us to write code once and use it over and over. They have a few key components:

function - The keyword telling Lua that we want to make a function
getTravelTime - The name that describes what the function does, and is used when calling the function.
(mph, miles) - Function parameters are used to increase our function’s flexibility.
return travelTime - The return keyword tells Lua what to send back to our function call. I.e. the function above returns the travelTime variable.
getTravelTime(...) - A function can be called by using it’s name followed by arguments. This runs the code inside the function.
(10,60) - A function can have arguments that are values assigned to the parameters, like a value assigned to a variable.
Functions can be as simple or as complex as desired but are a key tool for writing efficient, readable, and well-organized code.
